### Recommendations :
1. Netflix should try to increase the number of TV shows by reaching out to customers and understanding what is popular in order to
increase it ºs TV Shows viewership.
2. The number of movies released drastically went down in 2020. Netflix should partner with Production houses and ramp up the
production and making of movies as soon as possible.
3. Netflix should focus on genres Action & Adventure, Comedy, Documentaries and Dramas because they are the ones with most
viewership and will likely bring more profits for the company. 4.The most popular markets for the company are United States and India
however United States is vastly ahead of India in terms of number of users so, the company should try to penetrate deeper into Indian
market by providing local language content in a very personalized way to each state of India. In the US, it should look for genres where
there has not been much success and try to promote them as well.
4. Also, according to the data, the best time to release movies is between week 1 and week 15. As for the TV shows it is the month of
December and July.
